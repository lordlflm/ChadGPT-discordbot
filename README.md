### What am I
I'm a discord bot that prevents your friends from polluting specific discord channels with bot commands while there's a channel meant for it. :rage:

I also have a feature that lets you compete with you friends in capture the flag challenges.

### Run me
```bash
pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv .venv

# on linux
. venv/bin/activate

# on windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

pip install discord
pip install dotenv
pip install json
pip install requests
pip install urllib # maybe urllib3
```
