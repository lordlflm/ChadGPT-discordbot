### What am I
I let friends organize and compete in online capture the flag challenges through a discord channel. :triangular_flag_on_post: 

I also have a feature that prevents your friends from polluting specific discord channels with bot commands while there's a channel meant for it. :rage:

### Commands
`!set_ctf_channel <channel>`  
`!set_ctf_mention <mention>` ***TODO***  
`!new <challenge_name> <challenge_url> <challenge_value>` (private command only)   
`!submit <challenge_name> <flag>` (private command only)  
`!leaderboard <leaderboard_length>`

`!restrict_command <restricted_command> <restricted_channel_1> ...`
